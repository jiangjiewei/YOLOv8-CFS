# create time: 2024.7.13

# Introduction
This repository contains the source code for the Automatic Location of cornea and conjuncitiva using YOLOv8-CFS. 


# Prerequisites
* Ubuntu: 18.04 lts
* Python 3.7.8
* Pytorch 1.6.0
* NVIDIA GPU + CUDA_10.1 CuDNN_7.5

This repository has been tested on four NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti. Configurations (e.g batch size, image patch size) may need to be changed on different platforms.

# Installation
Other packages are as follows:

* python == 3.9.7
* pytorch == 1.12.1 
* timm == 0.9.12  
* mmcv-full == 1.6.2  


# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
* The file "train.py" in /YOLOv8-CFS-Source is used for the YOLOv8-CFS model training.
* The file "val.py" in /YOLOv8-CFS-Source is used for the YOLOv8-CFS model testing.
* The file "Detect.py" in /YOLOv8-CFS-Source contains the YOLOv8-CFS model inference.
